Element LED Array Visualization code:

To run a simulation of the array, do:
./run_sim

To drive fadecandy with the visualization running, do:
./run_leds

If you're running a new fadecandy board, be sure to update the fcserver configuration JSON to use the new device serial number.

Sphere and ring parameters are contained within element_parametric.py. This script generates all the layout data for the sphere,
as well as the 2D mapping for the Processing sketch. The generator gets called every time ./run_leds or ./run_sim are executed,
ensuring that the layout data is always fresh.
